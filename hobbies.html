			<p>With this new freedom Yenima found new hobbies. She was able to read whatever she wanted and go shopping whenever she felt like it. She also enjoys traveling to new places and spending time with her family. Especially her granddaughter, Emily. All the hardships of coming to a new country and learning a new language were worth it. Yenima was able to provide a better life for herself and her family, all because of the courage she had at 25 years old to come all alone to a new country.</p>

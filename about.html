			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Yenima Picanco grew up in Havana, Cuba in the early â€™70s. Growing up in Cuba during that time was not easy as it was under the power of Dictator Fidel Castro. During that time there was little to no freedom. Yenima spent most of her days playing outside with friends to distract herself from the difficult living conditions. At that time food was rationed and entertainment was limited and controlled by the government. In 1991, Yenima had her first daughter, Neylin. Coincidentally, that year was also the fall of the Soviet Union. This time is known as the Special Period. Yenima was trying to raise her newborn baby in the middle of an economic crisis as a single mother. She finally decided that this is not what she wanted for her baby and decided to apply for a visa to the United States.</p>

			<p>In November of 1995, Yenima received the news that she had been approved for a visa to the U.S. She was excited to finally leave Cuba and for the opportunity to have a better life. In March of 1996, Yenima packed her bags and moved to the United States with her four-year-old daughter. When she arrived in Miami, FL, she felt a sense of happiness and relief to finally be in the U.S. She finally had freedom. Shortly after, Yenima later moved to Orlando, FL where she had her second daughter in 1997, Jenny. Yenima was now a single mother with two daughters, but she continued to persevere. </p>

			<p> She bought her first home in 2005, but in 2007, during the Financial Crisis, she sold the house and moved to Connecticut where she met Mike, the love of her life. In 2012, they got married. In 2015, her oldest daughter gave birth to her first granddaughter. </p>
